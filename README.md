## Reflection of Learning

When did this project occur?
   - Example: This project occurred during our 6th week of the classroom.

What did you learn from the project? Technology? Pattern?
   - Example: This assignment covered handling click events within React. In doing so, we got the opportunity to explore how currying works to pass information about what was clicked, to the logic that handles the click. This became helpful because to date, we had been creating individual click handler methods for each interactive element, rather than being efficient and creating one method that could handle all of them.
